# Getting Started with Logo Generator App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses Material UI Theme

### Working

1. Firstly created Logos on Figma/Adobe Illustrator and exported them as SVG. Added them to the Images Directory of the
   project.Imported them as well into the project and made a list of 9 items.
2. Created the Google Font pairs for Company Name and Slogan that goes well with logos and created a list of 9 items.
3. Now that I have Logos(9) and Font pairs(9), I just shuffled both the list 9*9 , giving me 81 different combination of
   logos
4. Lastly I have added some validation for the length on company name (<=15 characters) and slogan(<=15 characters) so
   that the logo looks neat and clean.
